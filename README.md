# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Project
This project was created as part of a submission for the Artificial Intelligence with Python Nanodegree via Udacity.com

It involves two main parts:

1. An image classifier model, which uses pre-trained neural networks (VGG) to train a neural network to recognise any image of
a flower that I wish to pass to it, and the resulting output is a prediction by way of a list of probabilities and names
of exactly what type of flower it is.

2. A program built using Python which allows any user to input a series of arguments via arg_parser in order to use my trained
network to determine what type of flower their own image is.
